
# Standard build-docs.ps1 for .NET projects built on Windows, producing HTML documentation with
# Sandcastle Help File Builder. It builds a single documentation set that may include multiple
# projects.
#
# It has the following preconditions:
# - $LD_RELEASE_DOCS_TITLE is set to the displayable title of the documentation (not including
#   the version number); if this is not set, the script will not run
# - $LD_RELEASE_DOCS_TARGET_FRAMEWORK is the target framework of the build that the documentation
#   should be based on. The default is "net45". This must be a target framework that is built
#   by default when build.ps1 builds the solution.
# - $LD_RELEASE_DOCS_ASSEMBLIES is a space-delimited list of the names of all assemblies that are
#   to be documented (see below).
#
# The default is to document all of the assemblies whose projects are under .\src (like build.ps1
# it assumes that the subdirectories in .\src are named the same as their assemblies, and so
# are their project files). If you specify $LD_RELEASE_DOCS_ASSEMBLIES, you should provide the
# of the projects in .\src that you wish to document, and you can also add names of assemblies
# that are in your project's dependencies, if they were published with XML docs.
